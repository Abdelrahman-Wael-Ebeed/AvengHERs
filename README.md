I am thrilled to announce that my team and I have made it to the semi-finals and secured 4th place in the robotics competition at HAW University!

It has been an incredible journey, and I am extremely proud of the hard work and dedication that my team put into this competition. The countless hours spent designing, building, and testing our robot have truly paid off, and I am so grateful for the opportunity to work alongside such a talented group of individuals.

Competing in this robotics competition has not only allowed us to showcase our skills and knowledge, but it has also provided us with a unique opportunity to convey our message as “AvengHERs” was not just a team name, it was a powerful message that we wanted to convey to the world. Through our participation in the robotics competition, we aimed to celebrate March as Women's History Month, raise awareness about women's football, and stand up against gender discrimination in all its forms.

Thank you to HAW University and all those involved in organizing this competition. It has been an honour to participate and represent our team.
